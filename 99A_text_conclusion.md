### Conclusion

This project answered the questions posed in the introduction as follows:

1. What additional trends can be identified with machine learning and graph analysis?
<br></br>
<br></br>
**Households Table: Higher vehicle usage had high feature importance for predicting household vehicle count. Also, mass transit usage had low feature importance which implies it is independent of household vehicle count. Based on these results, it can be inferred that households in urban areas are more likely to be located near mass transit. However, mass usage has low feature importance with vehicle count whereas vehicle usage has has high feature importance for predicting household vehicle count.**
<br></br>
<br></br>
**Trips Table: Longer distance and duration trips had high feature importance for predicting vehicle miles traveled. Also, urban density had low feature importance which implies it is independent of vehicle miles traveled. Based on these results, it can be inferred that vehicle miles traveled is likely to be determined by trip distance and duration. However, urban density has low feature importance with vehicle miles traveled.**
<br></br>
<br></br>
**Vehicles Table: Household income and vehicle count had high feature importance for predicting vehicle miles traveled. Also, urban density had low feature importance which implies it is independent of annual vehicle miles traveled. Based on these results, it can be inferred that annual vehicle miles traveled is likely to be higher in households with higher income and vehicle count. However, urban density has low feature importance with annual vehicle miles traveled.**
<br></br>
<br></br>
**Driver Behavior: The analysis demonstrated that vehicle count and usage are not influenced by mass transit access; however, access does help reduce overall miles traveled and trip duration. Residents in areas without mass transit intuitively drive more frequently. Residents with high income typically had a higher vehicle count per household. As a result, residents in rural areas or higher income would be target demographics to analyze driving behavior.**
<br></br>
<br></br>

2. Can these trends help reduce average U.S. commute times?
<br></br>
<br></br>
**Since vehicle count and usage are influenced by income level and location, residents with higher income or in rural areas would be target demographics to analyze driving behavior. Additional analysis of trip type and comparison with vehicle usage may provide additional insights into travel.**
<br></br>
<br></br>

3. If so, then what are some recommendations to do so?
<br></br>
<br></br>
**Analyzing select demographics and trip types insight into how to influence driving behavior to reduce vehicle usage. In addition, living within an urban area with mass transit offers a convenient alternative to driving and intuitively reduces vehicle usage.**
<br></br>
<br></br>

### Next Steps

The following steps can be taken to continue project results:

1. Continue analysis of demographic types; specifically. residents with higher income or in rural areas.
2. Continue analysis of trip type; specifically, reason for taking shorter trips (commute, errands, etc.).
3. Continue graph analysis and build subgraphs of trips with multiple destinations.
