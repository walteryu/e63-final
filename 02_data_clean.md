### Data Cleaning and Preparation

Data cleaning was completed prior to analysis; as a result, the datasets were cleaned to minimize the impact of outlier, missing or repeated values as follows:

1. Replaced empty and missing values since they may cause errors during analysis.
2. Removed negative values since they may skew summary statistics and results.
3. Removed outlier values by removing values greater or less than 3 standard deviations from the mean since they will skew results. Specifically, outlier values will skew summary statistics such as the mean, median and standard deviation.

After data cleaning, the household, trip and vehicle tables were sorted by census district to begin the analysis.

### Household Count by Division

The weighted household count was calculated to identify the following:

1. Which divisions have the most households?
2. How do household count differ between divisions with and without subway systems?
3. Are there any other noticeable trends based on chart plot?

As a result, household count was plotted in the chart below with the following observations:

1. Total Count: The Pacific and Atlantic divisions had the highest count while the Central divisions; this trend is intuitive given that many costal states have higher populations than those in the midwest.
2. Subway Systems: The Pacific and Atlantic had more households with access to a subway system then those which did not have access; however, the Central divisions had more households without access to a subway system than those which did have access.
3. Subway Access: The trend observed above implies that the Pacific and Atlantic regions may have more urban areas with more households centered around transportation hubs instead of more rural or equal distribution of the population as in the Central divisions.
4. In general, household count is highest in the Pacific and Atlantic divisions with a higher percentage of households having access to a subway system whereas household count is lower the Central divisions with lower percentage of households having access to a subway system.
