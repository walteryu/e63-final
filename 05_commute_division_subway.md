### Commute Time per Household by Census Divisions

The average commute time per household by division were calculated to identify commute trends; as a result, the trips table was sorted as follows:

1. The households within each selected division were matched with trip values.
2. The commute time for each joined value were totaled, then divided by total households.
3. Result was average commute time per household by division.

Results were plotted in chart below with the following observations:

1. Average Commute: Higher commute times were observed in all divisions with access to a subway system which may be a result of them being located in urban areas with higher traffic congestion. In addition, this observation implies that subway systems are having an impact in reducing commute time within areas that already have high traffic congestion.
2. Commute Time Distribution: Average commute time was slightly higher in the Pacific/Atlantic divisions and lower in the Central regions. This observation implies that the Pacific/Atlantic divisions have more urban areas with shorter distances, whereas the Central divisions have more rural areas with longer distances.
