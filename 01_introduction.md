## Improving Commute Time with Data Analysis

### Authors: Bonny Nyaga, P.E. and Walter Yu, P.E.

### Abstract

The average commute time within each U.S. state has a large impact on its economy, productivity, infrastructure and environment. Longer commute times cause lost wages for workers with longer commute times, additional wearing of highway infrastructure and environmental impacts. As a result, this study evaluates commute patterns in U.S. states with the NHTS dataset$^{1}$ and provides recommendations for reducing the average commute time based on data analysis results.

### Introduction

This study outlines the data, methods and results used to identify trends and provide recommendations. Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions regarding trash control:

1. What are the states with the highest average weighted trips per household$^{2}$?
2. What are the average commute distance/time within those states?
3. What are some recommendations for improving commute times based on NHTS data analysis and demographic data$^{3}$?

### NHTS Data Analysis

This study analyzes the households and trips tables of the NHTS dataset since it focuses on commute times in U.S. states. The person and vehicle tables were reviewed but used sparingly as part of the NHTS data analysis.

### Tools and Process

The tools and process listed below were used to create the data model for this study:

1. Jupyter Notebook - Exploratory data analysis, visualization and regression models were completed using Python within this notebook.
2. Python Modules - The modules listed below were used for this study and will need to be installed in order to run this notebook:

  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * SciPy
  * Seaborn
  * Matplotlib
  * StatsModels
  * Scikit-Learn
