### Annual Miles per Household by Census Divisions

The average miles per household by division were calculated to identify commute trends; as a result, the vehicle table was sorted as follows:

1. The households within each selected division were matched with vehicle values.
2. The annual miles for each joined value were totaled, then divided by total households.
3. Result was average annual miles per household by division.

Results were plotted in chart below with the following observations:

1. Total Miles: Total miles traveled were lower in divisions with access to a subway system than those without access to one (except for the South-Atlantic which had slightly higher miles traveled). This implies that more residents may be taking the subway and reducing the number of miles traveled.
2. Pacific/Atlantic Divisions: These divisions showed the largest decrease in miles traveled with access to a subway system than those without access. This implies that subway systems in more urban/densely populated divisions may reduce the total number of miles traveled and minimize impacts to the environment and infrastructure.
