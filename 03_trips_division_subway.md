1. Selected census divisions with the 5 highest total of weighted households per the NHTS codebook.
2. Divisions were further sorted by ones with and without subway system.
3. The households identified in these divisions were then matched with trips.
4. The weighted trip values within each division were totaled, then divided by total households.
5. Result was average weighted trips per household by division.

The divisions identified with highest total weight households were as follows:

1. Mid-Atlantic > 1M with Subway
2. Mid-Atlantic > 1M w/o Subway
